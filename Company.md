# OnboardGPT
## Vision
- The future is decentralized customized GPTs everywhere
- Accelerating the deployment of intellgence in organizaitons, homes, personal phones
- Everyone will have their own GPT; TESS like the movie Salvation and billionaire Darius Tanz

## Mission
- 10xing the next billion software developer
- ChatGPT for Codebase Assistance
- ChatGPT for Businesses
- ChatGPT for Developers
- Make onboarding easier
- Customize LLMs for businesses needs
- Empowering every company with John Carmack Engineers assistance
- Integrate AI into each cycle of the software development to solve pain points
- Ship software 10x faster

## Pitch
- What if you could always chat with a 10x engineer that knows your codebase inside and out?
- What if when you onboard engineers they always were able to chat with a codebase assistance about your company? Making onboarding easier?
- What if you could chat with your codebase 24x7? 
- What if your codebase was alive? Embedding the learnings of decades of engineers who wrote the first line of code.
- It's not a matter of if someone is going to build it, someone will build it for sure
- AI is great at understanding code and writing; we need a framework to customize it per company, and make it a great tool for humans to develop code
- We want to accelerate solo-preneurs and 100x software developers productivity
- We want to give codebases a personality, an identity
- Software Management 2.0
- OpenAI is building AGI, OnboardGPT will bring it to organizations and individuals!

## Motivation
- Onboarding processes are hard, take time for newcomers like interns or junior engineers to hit the ground running
- Lots of internal tools with docs that aren't sufficient sometime
- Peers busy doing other things
- 80% of coding is spent on debugging.
- ChatGPT has proven that theirs a deep need for assistance in brain-heavy tasks, these LLMs are powerful when they have simple interfaces to use
- LLMs is going to change the way we write software, let's make sure it's safe for software engineers

## Features
- Ask OnboardGPT questions you'd ask senior engineers working on your codebase
- Explain industry regulations and rules like the travel industry at IBS Software
- Review my code
- Make debugging faster: read logs + familiar with codebase -> faster suggestions
- Code recommendations
- Vulnerability detection: ensuring the security of software products
- Code optimization suggestions
- A fun collaborator that's always online, can chat with it when bored
- Writes unit tests for your codebase, just tell it what you want to test
- Oneshot software development: write an app, build front page, debug backend, detect data leaks
- Brainstorm potential internal tools that would make engineers life more easier, like gcmprod leaf
- Replace wiki's or docs, because they're boring and general
- Talk with everything: books, papers, history
- WebGPT, access docs on the internet or information
- Don't leak private information
- Change OnboardGPT to personal preference: name, voice, gender. User will be prompted with a few questions for preferences like movie Her 
- Talk with audio, video, everything
- What if someone is starting a project from scratch, how can we help him build a project faster?
- Chatbot should self improve, as more code is added to the system

## Strategy
1. Show an MVP that works on something a lot of people use (library like numpy, python project that's well documented) -> gain traction
2. Get access to OpenAI's latest and greatest GPT models like Harvey
3. Expand to different programming languages, entreprises size, students, interns, new hires, etc
